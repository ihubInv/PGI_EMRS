    "description": "Developmental motor coordination disorder is characterised by a significant delay in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills and impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness, or inaccuracy of motor performance. Coordinated motor skills are markedly below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g. in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities). Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not solely attributable to a Disease of the Nervous System, Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, sensory impairment, and not better explained by a Disorder of Intellectual Development.",

    "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder",
    "description": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern (at least 6 months) of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning. There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication.",

Ideally, use of this category should be based on the results of locally validated, standardized neuropsychological assessments, although such measures may not be available in all settings. The rating should be made based on the severity of cognitive symptoms during the past week.",

Catatonia can occur in the context of another mental disorder, such as Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorders, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, especially Autism Spectrum Disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal from certain psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of certain psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Finally, Catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Examples of medical conditions that may be associated with Catatonia include diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, and encephalitis.",

    "description": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is characterised by the presence of persistent obsessions or compulsions, or most commonly both. Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts, images, or impulses/urges that are intrusive, unwanted, and are commonly associated with anxiety. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them by performing compulsions. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours including repetitive mental acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, or to achieve a sense of ‘completeness’. In order for obsessive-compulsive disorder to be diagnosed, obsessions and compulsions must be time consuming (e.g. taking more than an hour per day) or result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.",

    "description": "Anorexia Nervosa is characterised by significantly low body weight for the individual’s height, age and developmental stage that is not due to another health condition or to the unavailability of food. A commonly used threshold is body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m² in adults and BMI-for-age under 5th percentile in children and adolescents. Rapid weight loss (e.g. more than 20% of total body weight within 6 months) may replace the low body weight guideline as long as other diagnostic requirements are met. Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to gain weight as expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather than weight loss. Low body weight is accompanied by a persistent pattern of behaviours to prevent restoration of normal weight, which may include behaviours aimed at reducing energy intake (restricted eating), purging behaviours (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives), and behaviours aimed at increasing energy expenditure (e.g. excessive exercise), typically associated with a fear of weight gain. Low body weight or shape is central to the person's self-evaluation or is inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive.",

Alcohol—more specifically termed ethyl alcohol or ethanol—is an intoxicating compound produced by fermentation of sugars usually in agricultural products such as fruits, cereals, and vegetables with or without subsequent distillation. There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a central nervous system depressant. In addition to ability to produce Alcohol Intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing properties, resulting in Alcohol Dependence in some people and Alcohol Withdrawal when alcohol use is reduced or discontinued. Unlike most other substances, elimination of alcohol from the body occurs at a constant rate, such that its clearance follows a linear rather than a logarithmic course. Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from behaviour during Alcohol Intoxication is well recognized and is included in the definitions of harmful use of alcohol (i.e., Episode of Harmful Use of Alcohol and Harmful Pattern of Use of Alcohol). Several alcohol-induced mental disorders (e.g., Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder) and alcohol-related forms of neurocognitive impairment (e.g., Dementia Due to Use of Alcohol) are recognized.",

Cannabis is the collective term for a range of psychoactive preparations of the cannabis plant, Cannabis sativa, and related species and hybrids. Cannabis contains cannabinoids, a class of diverse chemical compounds that act on endogenous cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitter release in the brain. The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabis is typically smoked in the form of the flowering heads or leaves of the marijuana plant; tobacco is often mixed with cannabis when smoked. There are also cannabis oils that are prepared from these same sources. These preparations vary considerably in their THC potency. Cannabis has predominantly central nervous system depressant effects and produces a characteristic euphoria that may be part of the presenting features of Cannabis Intoxication, which may also include impairment in cognitive and psychomotor functioning. Cannabis has dependence-producing properties resulting in Cannabis Dependence in some people and Cannabis Withdrawal when use is reduced or discontinued. Cannabis is associated with a range of Cannabis-Induced Mental Disorders.",

Opioids is a generic term that encompasses the constituents or derivatives of the opium poppy Papaver somniferum as well as a range of synthetic and semisynthetic compounds, some related to morphine and others chemically distinct but all having their primary actions on the µ opioid receptor. Examples of opioids include morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), fentanyl, pethidine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine and d-propoxyphene. The opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies and are primarily central nervous system depressants. They suppress respiration as well as other vital functions and are a common cause of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including heroin, a common and potent opioid that is primarily used non-medically. Therapeutic opioids are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in cancer pain and palliative care, although they are also used for non-therapeutic reasons. In some countries morbidity and mortality related to therapeutic opioids is greater than that related to heroin. All opioids may result in Opioid Intoxication, Opioid Dependence and Opioid Withdrawal. A range of Opioid-Induced Disorders occur, some of which occur following Opioid Withdrawal.",

They include the benzodiazepines and the non-benzodiazepine positive allosteric modulators of GABA receptors (i.e., ‘Z-drugs’) as well as many other compounds. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics include barbiturates, which are available much less commonly now than in previous decades.

    "description": "Disorders due to use of cocaine are characterised by the pattern and consequences of cocaine use. Cocaine is a compound found in the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylum coca, which is indigenous to countries in northern regions of South America. Cocaine has a limited place in medical treatment as an anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive agent. It is commonly used illicitly and widely available across the world, where it is found in two main forms: cocaine hydrochloride and cocaine freebase (also known as ‘crack’). Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant, and Cocaine Intoxication typically includes a state of euphoria and hyperactivity. Cocaine has potent dependence-producing properties and Cocaine Dependence is a common cause of morbidity and of clinical presentations. Cocaine Withdrawal has a characteristic course that includes lethargy and depressed mood. A range of Cocaine-Induced Mental Disorders is described.",

They are time-limited and abate as cocaine is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include inappropriate euphoria, anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation (sometimes of delusional intensity), auditory hallucinations, confusion, and changes in sociability.

Prescribed stimulants including dexamphetamine are indicated for a limited number of conditions such as for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Methcathinone, known in many countries as ephedrone, is a synthetic potent stimulant that is a structural analogue of methamphetamine and is related to cathinone. All these drugs have primarily psychostimulant properties and are also vasoconstrictors to a varying degree. They induce euphoria and hyperactivity as may be seen in Stimulant Intoxication. They have potent dependence-producing properties, which may lead to the diagnosis of Stimulant Dependence and Stimulant Withdrawal following the cessation of use.

The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use stimulants, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use stimulants. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of stimulants, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of stimulants, or repeated use of stimulants or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if stimulant use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.",

    "description": "Synthetic cathinone dependence is a disorder of regulation of synthetic cathinone use arising from repeated or continuous use of synthetic cathinones. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use synthetic cathinones, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use synthetic cathinones. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of synthetic cathinones, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of synthetic cathinones, or repeated use of synthetic cathinones or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if synthetic cathinone use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.",

The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of Caffeine intoxication or Caffeine withdrawal. The amount and duration of caffeine use must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear-related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the caffeine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the caffeine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with caffeine use).",

    "description": "Disorders due to use of hallucinogens are characterised by the pattern and consequences of hallucinogen use. Several thousand compounds have hallucinogenic properties, many of which are found in plants (e.g., mescaline) and fungi (e.g., psilocybin) or are chemically synthesized (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]). These compounds have primarily hallucinogenic properties, but some may also be stimulants. Much of the morbidity associated with these compounds arises from the acute effects related to Hallucinogen Intoxication. Hallucinogen Dependence is rare and Hallucinogen Withdrawal is not described. Among the mental disorders related to hallucinogen use, Hallucinogen-Induced Psychotic Disorder is the most frequently seen, although worldwide it is still fairly uncommon.",

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of nicotine and their intensity is closely related to the amount of nicotine consumed. They are time-limited and abate as nicotine is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include restlessness, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, cold sweats, headache, insomnia, palpitations, paresthesias, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, confusion, bizarre dreams, burning sensations in the mouth, and salivation. In rare instances, paranoid ideation, perceptual disturbances, convulsions or coma may occur. Nicotine intoxication occurs more commonly in naïve (non-tolerant) users or among those taking higher than accustomed doses.",

They have a range of pharmacological properties but are predominantly central nervous system depressants, with many also having vasoactive effects. They tend to be used by younger persons and may be used when access to alternative psychoactive substances is difficult or impossible. Volatile Inhalant Intoxication is well recognized. Volatile inhalants have dependence-producing properties and Volatile Inhalant Dependence and Volatile Inhalant Withdrawal is recognized although comparatively uncommon worldwide.

The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use MDMA or related drugs, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use MDMA or related drugs. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of MDMA or related drugs, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of MDMA or related drugs, or repeated use of MDMA or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if MDMA or related drug use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.",

Dissociative drugs include ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP) and their (comparatively rare) chemical analogues. Ketamine is an intravenous anaesthetic widely used in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, and in emergency situations. Ketamine is also undergoing evaluation for treatment of some mental disorders (e.g., treatment resistant Depressive Disorders). It is also a widespread drug of nonmedical use in many countries and may be taken by the oral or nasal routes or injected. It produces a sense of euphoria but depending on the dose, emergent hallucinations and dissociation are recognised as unpleasant side effects. Phencyclidine has a more restricted worldwide distribution and also has euphoric and dissociative effects. Its use may result in bizarre behaviour uncharacteristic for the individual, including self-harm. Dissociative Drug Dependence is described but a withdrawal syndrome is not recognized by most authorities. Several Dissociative Drug-Induced Mental Disorders are recognised.",

No features of the disorder are present during childhood prior to adolescence (e.g., before 10 years of age). To be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be enduring over a significant period of time (e.g., 12 months or more). Isolated dissocial or criminal acts are thus not in themselves grounds for the diagnosis.",

That is, neurocognitive disorders do not include disorders characterised by deficits in cognitive function that are present from birth or that typically arise during the developmental period, which are classified in the grouping neurodevelopmental disorders. Rather, neurocognitive disorders represent a decline from a previously attained level of functioning. Although cognitive deficits are present in many mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorders), only disorders whose core features are cognitive are included in the neurocognitive disorders grouping. In cases where the underlying pathology and aetiology for neurocognitive disorders can be determined, the identified etiology should be classified separately.",

    "description": "Dementia due to Huntington disease occurs as part of a widespread degeneration of the brain due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which is transmitted through autosomal dominance. Onset of symptoms is insidious typically in the third and fourth decade of life with gradual and slow progression. Initial symptoms typically include impairments in executive functions with relative sparing of memory, prior to the onset of motor deficits (bradykinesia and chorea) characteristic of Huntington disease.",

The characteristic cognitive impairments in Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins depend on the specific heavy metal or toxin that the individual has been exposed to but can affect any cognitive domain. Onset of symptoms is related to exposure and progression can be rapid especially with acute exposure. In many cases, symptoms are reversible when exposure is identified and ceases. Investigations such as brain imaging or neurophysiological testing may be abnormal. Lead poisoning is associated with abnormalities on brain imaging including widespread calcification and increased signal on MRI T2-weighted images of periventricular white matter, basal ganglia hypothalamus and pons. Dementia due to aluminium toxicity may demonstrate characteristic paroxysmal high-voltage delta EEG changes. Examination may make evident other features such as peripheral neuropathy in the case of lead, arsenic, or mercury.",

The course of Dementia due to human immunodeficiency virus varies including resolution of symptoms, gradual decline in functioning, improvement, or fluctuation in symptoms. Rapid decline in cognitive functioning is rare with the advent of antiretroviral medications.",

Onset is insidious and there is a rapid progression of symptoms and impairment characterised by cognitive deficits, ataxia, and motor symptoms (myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia).

Cataplexy is a sudden and uncontrollable loss of muscle tone arising during wakefulness that is typically triggered by a strong emotion, such as excitement or laughter. Although cataplexy is a pathognomonic symptom of type 1 narcolepsy, it may not manifest until years following onset of the sleepiness. In such cases, a diagnosis of narcolepsy, type 1 may be made based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-hypocretin levels < 110 picograms per milliliter.

Polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) findings characteristic of narcolepsy (i.e., two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP’s), or one or more SOREMP’s on MSLT and a SOREMP on the preceding overnight polysomnography) should also be absent. The daytime sleepiness is not better explained by another disorder (e.g., insufficient sleep syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), a substance or medication, or a medical condition). Objective evidence of hypersomnolence is indicated by an MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes or by polysomnography or wrist actigraphy showing a total 24-hour sleep time of 11 hours or more. Prolonged and severe sleep inertia is often observed and consists of sustained difficulty waking up with repeated returns to sleep, irritability, automatic behaviour, and confusion. In contrast to narcolepsy, naps are generally long, often more than 60 minutes, and unrefreshing.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep, objective demonstration of excessive sleepiness and absence of REM-related findings by multiple sleep latency test (MSLT/PSG).",

When awake during episodes, most patients are exhausted, apathetic, confused, and slow in speaking and answering. Hyperphagia, hypersexuality, childish behaviour, depression, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions are often observed during the episodes. Patients are normal between episodes with regard to sleep, cognition, mood, and eating. Rarely, Kleine Levin syndrome may occur exclusively during menstrual periods.",

If the presence of hypercapnia has been established, a diagnosis of sleep-related hypoventilation should be made, rather than sleep-related hypoxemia.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnographic monitoring of oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SaO2) in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the declines in SaO2.",

Onset is associated with pregnancy, from the first trimester to post-partum, most commonly in the second trimester. Pemphigoid gestationis may also occur in association with the trophoblastic tumours, hydatiform mole and choriocarcinoma, which express paternal antigens. The disease usually begins with intensely itchy urticated plaques around the umbilicus and then spreads to the rest of the trunk and to the limbs, with blister formation. Mucosal involvement is rare. In about 3% of cases the neonate is also affected: chronic placental inflammation may lead to intrauterine growth retardation. The exact cause of the disease is unknown but it is mediated by auto-antibodies to the hemidesmosome component BP180 expressed in the placenta and in maternal and neonatal skin. IgG1 autoantibodies, which strongly bind complement, are directed against the hemidesmosome components, chiefly BP180 (BPAG2/collagen XVII) and to a lesser extent BP230 (BPAg1), causing inflammation and subepidermal blistering. Diagnosis is confirmed by standard histopathology showing epidermal and papillary dermal oedema with eosinophilic spongiosis and subepidermal blisters with eosinophils. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence shows C3 and IgG at the basement membrane zone. Topical and systemic steroids are the treatment of choice. The condition resolves post partum but may take many months to do so; flares with menstruation or the oral contraceptive pill may occur. The condition recurs in 90% of subsequent pregnancies.",
